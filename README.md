# Installation

```
go install github.com/AntoineToussaint/wtfa@latest
```

and make sure your $GOBIN is in your path.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

Thank you to OneTurnMore on reddit to point me to this:

It does the same, better but not looking at your history but intercepting your command. So very cool.
